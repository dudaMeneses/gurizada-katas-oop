# gurizada-katas-oop

>>> Kata is a Japanese word (型 or 形) meaning literally "form" referring to a detailed choreographed 
>>> pattern of movements made to be practised alone, and also within groups and in unison when training. 
>>> It is practised in Japanese martial arts as a way to memorize and perfect the movements being executed. 
>>> Korean martial arts with Japanese influence (hapkido, Tang Soo Do) use the derived term hyeong (hanja: 形) 
>>> and also the term pumsae (hanja: 品勢 hangeul: 품새).

<p>A ideia de exercicios neste molde na programacao: criarei um projeto com problemas de estrutura a serem resolvidos (nos quais as instrucoes estarao no codigo) e alguns testes unitarios para serem rodados a cada passo efetuado. Ao final da resolucao de todos os testes unitarios todos os topicos de OOP terao sido cobertos.</p>
